<h2>Getting Here<h2>
<h3>By Cycle</h3>
<p>Cambridge is the cycling capital of the UK. BAS encourages visitors to consider arriving by bike wherever possible.  The recommended bicycle route to BAS from the railway station and the city centre is shown in the Google map.</p>
<p>Allow approximately 30 minutes from the station and 20 minutes from the city centre. There are Cycle Hire shops in the railway station car park and in the Grand Arcade and the Market Square in the city centre. Sheltered bicycle parking is available at BAS.</p>

<h3>By Bus</h3>
<p>From Cambridge train station to British Antarctic Survey you can catch the Universal bus (marked with a "U") which runs between Eddington (the new north-west Cambridge site) and Addenbrookes via the Rail Station. Weekdays: 15 minute service 07:00 to 19:30; Saturdays: 20 minute service 08:00 to 18:30 (no Sunday service). For more information and a map <a href="https://map.cam.ac.uk/#52.196113,0.113125,14,T:/universalbus">see here</a>.</p>
<p>If you are coming from the rail station, disembark the U bus at the "Philippa Fawcett Drive" stop on Charles Babbage Road, turn to your right and walk to the end of the road (two minutes), turn right onto High Cross and walk for approx two more minutes until British Antarctic Survey reception is on your left.</p>
<p>The nearest bus station is the <a href="https://bustimes.org.uk/stops/0500CCITY144">Madingley Road Park and Ride</a> directly across the road from the British Antarctic Survey. Buses run every 10 minutes between here and the city centre bus station. Cambridgeshire County Council provide a <a href="http://www.cambridgeshire.gov.uk/">map of the park and ride routes on their website</a>.</p>
<p>As you leave the Park and Ride entrance on the right hand side, on foot, turn right onto Madingley Road, cross over the road and walk until you reach a gap in the fence directly behind a small lay-by, then walk directly ahead until you reach the BAS Entrance and Reception to your right — approximately in the centre of the east face of the building.</p>
<p>The city centre bus station is on Drummer Street. Most bus services, including National Express coaches from London and many other UK cities, will stop here. There is also a taxi rank right next to where the airport coaches arrive/depart. A Day Rider ticket allowing unlimited travel within the city for one day currently costs &pound;3.70, and a Mega Rider 7 day ticket costs &pound;12.50 (September 2012).</p>

<h3>By Train</h3>
<p>The nearest rail station is Cambridge. There are direct trains from London (King’s Cross Station and Liverpool Street Station) which take about one hour; and London Stansted Airport which take about 35 minutes.</p>

<ul>

    <li>M11: Junctions 11 (Trumpington Park & Ride) and 13 (Madingley Road Park & Ride)</li>
    <li>A1307: coming from the south of Cambridge (Babraham Road Park & Ride)</li>
</ul>

<h3>By Air</h3>
<p>Cambridge is served by three major airports:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.stanstedairport.com/">London Stansted</a> (the closest)</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.heathrowairport.com/">London Heathrow</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://www.gatwickairport.com/">London Gatwick</a> (the furthest away)</li>
</ul>

<p>From London Stansted, Cambridge can be easily reached by rail, coach or taxi:</p>
<ul>
    <li>there is a direct train to Cambridge, which takes 35 minutes and costs around &pound;10 one way;</li>
    <li>there are National Express coach services to Cambridge from all three airports and a one way ticket costs around &pound;10 - &pound;30;</li>
    <li>a taxi from London Stansted Airport to BAS will take around 40 minutes.</li>
</ul>
