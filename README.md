# sips.github.io

This is the source for the [SiPS site](https://software-in-polar-science.github.io/).

Built by hand, using open source software.

## Usage

This site is built using Jinja templates into the `_site` directory, upon which it's 
deployed statically using GitHub pages.

To develop locally, you want to have a working knowledge of HTML, CSS and Python w/Jinja. 
Install a development environment using 

```
python -m venv venv
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then run `make all` to regenerate `_site`, check it in your local browser, then upload.

A business/corporate style responsive site template. It's pretty barebones but should
go over pretty well for folks wanting to get their serious business on.
